### :desktop_computer: **System Requirements**
You‚Äôll need Node.js installed.

- Install at least v16.x or higher as this is the oldest active LTS version
- Only releases that are or will become an LTS release are officially supported ( If Node is not currently installed on your system, we suggest utilizing a tool such as NVM or Volta to assist in managing multiple active Node.js versions. NVM is a popular choice, while Volta is also a good alternative. )
